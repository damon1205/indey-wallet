# Indy SDK

This is the official SDK for [Hyperledger Indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects),
which provides a distributed-ledger-based foundation for [self-sovereign identity](https://sovrin.org).
The major artifact of the SDK is a c-callable
library; there are also convenience wrappers for various programming languages.
